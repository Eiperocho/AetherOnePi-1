# Questions to ask when working with radionics
The most dangerous pitfall in radionics or dowsing is to ask the wrong questions or fail to ask the right questions, 
which leads to limited or erroneous information.

These are notes for programming an expert system.

## Essential questions before beginning to analyse or balance
If a person approach me, they want help (fact).

* Do I have permission to work with this person?
* * NO ... Will I ever have permission to work with this person?
* * * YES ... In what amount of time?

  The answer could be in 4 months.
(That person have something to experience in their live before they are ready for a radionics treatment)

* * * NO ... then I'm sorry, I am not the person for you (no treatment)
* Is it in the person's best and highest good that I work with them?
* Is it in my best and highest good?

## Analysis

* How many layers are there?
