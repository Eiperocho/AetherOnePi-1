## Developer Guide
Note: I will not give support to the novice in java programming. I assume that you are a professional developer if you read this chapter. I concentrate my time in research, developing and writing about radionics. It is not my task to teach you programming (even if I would love to).

### Requirements
- Java 8
- Maven 3
### Missing ControlP5 Lib
Call installLibsDependencies.bat for installing ControlP5 library in your local repository. Unfortunately this library is not available in maven central repository. You need to do this just once for your developer environment. I have added this call also in mvnw.cmd.
